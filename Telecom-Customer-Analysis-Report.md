## TITLE
TELECOM CUSTOMER CHURN ANALYSIS

## SUMMARY
A comprehensive data analysis project analyzing telecom customer churn patterns, conducted as part of the STC 6-Week Data Analyst Mentorship. The project includes data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and actionable recommendations to reduce customer churn and improve retention strategies.

## INTRODUCTION
This project analyzes telecom customer data to understand churn patterns and identify factors contributing to customer attrition. With the telecommunications industry facing increasing competition and customer acquisition costs, understanding why customers leave and developing effective retention strategies is crucial for business sustainability and growth.

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The project covers a complete end-to-end data analysis workflow including data exploration, cleaning, analysis, visualization, and strategic recommendations. The analysis spans 4 weeks of intensive work, from initial business question framing to final dashboard creation and stakeholder recommendations.

## PROJECT AIM
To analyze telecom customer data to identify churn patterns, understand customer behavior, and provide actionable recommendations for stakeholders to reduce customer churn and improve retention rates.

## ABOUT THE DATASET
* **Source**: Telecom Company Customer Database
* **Number of Records**: 7,043 customers
* **Key Metrics**: $21.37M total revenue, $3.68M revenue lost to churn
* **Key Fields**: 
  *	Customer Demographics (Age, Gender, Marital Status)
  *	Service Information (Phone Service, Internet Service, Multiple Lines)
  *	Contract Details (Contract Type, Payment Method, Tenure)
  *	Service Add-ons (Device Protection, Online Security, Streaming Services)
  *	Churn Status and Financial Impact
    
## TOOLS USED
* Microsoft Power BI - Dashboard creation and data visualization
*	Microsoft Excel - Initial data exploration and validation
*	Figma â€“ For designing dashboard background
  
## IMPORTING THE DATASET
The telecom customer dataset was imported directly into Power BI for comprehensive analysis and visualization. Data validation and initial exploration were conducted to understand the structure and quality of the dataset before proceeding with analysis.

## DATA CLEANING & TRANSFORMATION
**Data Quality Assessment:**
The dataset was relatively clean but required specific attention to handle missing values appropriately.

**Issues Identified:**
* Empty cells in dependent columns: Some columns had blank values due to logical dependencies on other columns. For instance, if Internet Service = "No" (customer did not subscribe to internet), then Internet Type was blank for that row.
* Null values in numeric columns: Fields like Avg Monthly Long Distance Charges contained null values because customers had not subscribed to home phone service.

**Cleaning Steps Performed:**
* Replaced null values in numeric columns with 0 - This accurately represented customers who didn't use specific services
* Replaced null text values with "Unknown" - Applied only to columns not dependent on other service subscriptions
* Maintained logical data relationships - Preserved the dependency structure between service subscription and related fields

**Data Structure:**
* No changes were made to column names as they were already in readable and clear format
* Preserved original data dictionary alignment for consistency and accuracy
